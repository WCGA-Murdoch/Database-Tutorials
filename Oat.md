# Oat pangenome databases
This section include the Introduction and Tutorials for the Oat pangenome tools available on the database.

## <span style="color:#023047"> I. Introduction </span>

The Oat databases includes:  
* Genome browsers with high quality assemblies and annotations of 24 Oat accessions.  
* Pan-transcriptome data of 24 Oat accessions.

## <span style="color:#023047"> II. Current available data </span>

### 1. Genome assembly and annotation

Including genome assemblies and annotations from 24 oat accessions. Detailed accession list can be seen in [Oat pangenome accessions](/info/oat_pangenome.md)

### 2. Genetic variants

Genetic variants including InDels and SNPs were obtained from a wide range of datasets, including:  
* High coverage - whole genome sequence of [564 oat accessions](info/oat_564.md) from a world-wide collection.  


### 3. Pan-transcriptome data

The Oat Pan-transcriptome database is obtained 6 different tissues of 24 Oat accessions from the pangenome collection.

### 1. Getting start

The WCGA Oat pangenome database can be accessed using this direct link [http://database.oatpangenome.com](http://database.oatpangenome.com)  
To start using the WCGA Oat pangenome database, you need to register an account. Please refer to the [Registration tutorials](tools/registration.md) for information about the registration process.  
For more information about each tool and available data, please refer to the below sections.  

### 2. Oat genome browser  

For a detailed instruction about using the Oat genome browser, please refer to this link: [The Oat genome browsers](tools/oat_jbrowse.md)

The Oat genome browsers were built based on [Jbrowse v2](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/) with whole genome sequences and annotations of 24 Oat accessions from the pangenome collection.

#### a. Features

* Genes lookup by gene IDs  
* Gene and CDS sequences extraction, including up stream and down stream regions  
* Cross-variant gene ID search. Search using Bannister and GS7 gene IDs on OT3098v2 positions, gene IDs matching.
* Genetic variants view with annotations  

#### b. Data currently available on the genome browsers

**Genome assembly tracks**

* Genome assemblies of 24 oat accession from the [Oat pangenome accessions](/info/oat_pangenome.md)   

**Annotations tracks**

* Functional annotations for 24 oat accession of the [Oat pangenome accessions](/info/oat_pangenome.md)  
* Bannister and GS7 lift off to OT3098v2 for quick gene ID convert (reference: OT3098v2 assembly)  

**Variant tracks - OT3098v2 reference**

* SNP data with annotations of [564 oat accessions](info/oat_564.md)  
* InDels data with annotations of [564 oat accessions](info/oat_564.md)  

## 3. Oat variant database

For a detailed instruction about using the BOat variant database, please refer to this link: [The Oat variant databases](tools/oat_variantdb.md)

#### a. Features

* Query using physical position or gene IDs  
* Extraction of genetic information around the variants for primers designing  
* Result table export to csv format  

#### b. Data currently available

The database currently contains approximately 350 million SNPs and 35 million InDels, from a collection of [564 oat accessions](info/oat_564.md)
The variant was the same data as loaded into the genome browsers. However, the variant database allows user to easily extract genetic information in a region around the variants for primers designing, as well as export result table to csv format.

### 4. Oat Pan-transcriptome database

Detailed instruction about using the [Oat Pan-transcriptome database](tools/oat_pantranscriptome.md)

#### a. Features

* Query for gene expression using GS7 or OT3098v2 gene IDs    
* Heatmap of gene expression of 6 different tissues from the Oat pangenome collection  
* Gene funtional annotations  

#### b. Data currently available

The database features gene expression heatmap of 6 different tissues:

* Leaf  
* Embryo  
* Root  
* Nod  
* Panicle  
* Caryopsis  

## <span style="color:#023047"> IV. Work in progress </span>

### 1. Oat genome browser  

* High coverage - whole genome sequence of [80 oat accessions](info/oat_80.md) highly related to Australian oat breeding programs.  
* Annotation lift of of Bilby to OT3098v2 for gene ID matching
