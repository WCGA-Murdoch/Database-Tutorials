# This page contains information about the Barley and Oat databases

## I. General information

Pan-genomic resources are getting more and more popular since they cover a wider range of genetic information compared to single references. At the Western Crop Genetics Alliance, we utilised cutting-edge sequencing technologies to obtain high-quality sequences from a wide range of commercial and wild accessions of barley and oats. The sequence data was used to generate high-quality genome assemblies, capture genetic variants and construct reference pan-genome graphs. These information were put together to form an interactive and searchable database, which could be made available to breeders to improve the genetic selection process and deliver improved varieties to growers across Australia.

### 1. Barley databases

The Barley databases includes:  
* Genome browsers with high quality assemblies and annotations of nearly 100 barley accessions.  
* Pan-genome presence/absence variation explorer (Panache) of 76 barley accessions.  
* Pan-transcriptome data of 20 barley accessions.

### 2. Oat databases

The Oat databases includes:  
* Genome browsers with high quality assemblies and annotations of 26 Oat accessions.  
* Pan-transcriptome data of 26 Oat accessions.  
* Genetic variant database of 564 Oat accessions
